## Scoring Strategy

### For 70-Mark Exam

| Coverage | Section A | Section B | Section C | Total | Percentage |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Tier A only** | ~10/14 | ~18/21 | ~28/35 | **~56/70** | **~80%** |
| **Tier A + B** | ~12/14 | ~21/21 | ~35/35 | **~68/70** | **~97%** |
| **Tier A only (minimum)** | 8/14 | 14/21 | 21/35 | **43/70** | **61%** ✅ Pass |

### Section-wise Approach
- **Section A:** Every Tier A topic generates 1–2 short questions. Know definitions cold.
- **Section B:** Prepare 4 out of 5 topics thoroughly (MapReduce, HDFS read/write, Hadoop ecosystem, HIVE, Pig comparisons).
- **Section C:** Each unit has exactly 1 question (2 options). Knowing 1 option well = full marks.
